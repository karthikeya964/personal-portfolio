    <div class="project">
      <h3>Intelligent Chatbot for Customer Support</h3>
      <p>develop a chatbot system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to handle customer inquiries in real-time. The bot can integrate with messaging platforms such as websites or WhatsApp, enabling automated responses for a wide range of customer requests. It can detect user intent (e.g., product inquiry or order status) and provide tailored responses by leveraging machine learning models like BERT or GPT-3. Additionally, the bot can be designed to perform sentiment analysis to determine if a user is upset or frustrated and escalate those interactions to a human representative. It would also include a backend analytics dashboard for businesses to monitor bot performance, user engagement, and commonly asked questions. Technologies involved could include Python, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3> IoT-based Smart Agriculture System</h3>
      <p>aimed at improving farming efficiency through automation and data-driven insights. By deploying sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and pH levels, the system can trigger automatic irrigation and generate data that helps farmers make informed decisions. A key feature would be integrating machine learning algorithms to predict crop growth, assess irrigation needs, and prevent resource waste. This system can be linked to a mobile application that alerts users about critical conditions and allows remote control of the irrigation process. Cloud platforms like Firebase can store sensor data, while tools such as Node-RED and TensorFlow can be used for data analysis and predictive analytics.</p>
